Site URL: http://vidoe.surge.sh/index.html
Video Streaming URL: http://vidoe.surge.sh/pages/video-page.html

This site is a replica in design and functionality of the following site:

https://askbootstrap.com/preview/vidoe/

NOTE: The above was taken just as a visual template reference.
All of the code in this project was made from scratch.

				  FEATURES

1. The organization of the code follows SMACSS and BEM Methodologies.
The code is assured to be modular and the majority of its elements are independent.
Elements can be reused and they will not be conflictive if the project grows
or if they are meant to be used in other projects as well.

2. Modular CSS With SASS, separated in four main categories:

	1.1 Base Styles
	1.2 Components
	1.3 Layout
	1.4 Utilities

3. mediaElement.js and its extension mediaElement-plugins.js was used for video
streaming with desired controls and to make sure cross-browsing coherence.
In the main page click on any video thumbnail to go to the video streaming page.

4. Side Navigation has toggle function when clicking the bars icons in the header.
It toggles different in smaller or larger devices.

5. Finite Carousel implemented. Note that this is not a plugin and was 100%
developed in vanilla JS by myself. The code can be found in this repository:
https://github.com/dannov91/carouselcode

6. All of JS files are separated into modules in /javascript/modules. Each page
then has its own consolidated script file taking the modules it needs.
